However, to actually provide a best, there must be some way that they are ranked. The \"best\" neighborhoods have the highest percentage score and the worst, the lowest. The highest ranked neighborhoods are Monongahela, South Park, and Tarnetum. The lowest ranked are Pittsburgh, Clairton, and Springdale. It makes sense that Pittsburgh has the most toxic releases out of all of the neighborhoods, it is right on a river and there are a lot of businesses there. "
